                <section><strong>Start of it all</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">5/20/2024</p></section>
                    <p>Classes started today. It was my first zoom call ever and I can't lie I was a little nervous. But it went great! Sarah was awesome and patient with all of us.</p>

                <section><strong>First day of Backend</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">5/27/2024</p></section>
                <p>It's Backend day! I am super excited to start my coding career. We met Travis, the new teacher, last week and he seems cool as hell and just as excited to teach me as I am to learn!</p>

                <section><strong>Reject the Regex</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">6/5/2024</p></section>
                    <p>What the heck did I just learn. Class was going smooth, homeworks were all on time and quizes were doing great but this...this stuff is hard. But I'm not gonna let it get me behind!</p>

                <section><strong>OOP Principles</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">6/18/2024</p></section>
                    <p>I thought Regexs were tricky but OOP's are stumping my brain.
                        classes make total sense to me but this style is hard! I dont even want to know what the weekend project is going to be like!</p>
                <section><strong>I like Databases</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">6/24/2024</p></section>
                    <p >Last week was a tough one, but I GET DATABASES! They make so much sense and I have a really good feeling about the weekend project! If I can finish the project on Saturday then Sunday I can have the whole day off!</p>
                
                <section><strong>Frontend Begins!</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">7/8/2024</p></section>
                    <p>First Day of Frontend is was good! I liked Dave, He had a lot of experience with teaching and his Portfolio website was sick!! Its time to get creative and let that artist in you out!</p>
