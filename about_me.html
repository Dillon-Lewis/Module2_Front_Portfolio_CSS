            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone! Here's a quick little backstory. I was born in Colorado with an amazing single mom and an identical twin brother. We grew up skiing most weekends through the winter and camping in the summer. I was always pushed to go outside as much and that is where my love for the outdoors and nature took off. We moved  to North Carolina when I was 10 and my passions began to unfold, the ocean. The Outer Banks provided a rich abundance of activities to do and I fell in love with them all. Fast forward 20 years, I have now been on numerous surf trips across the world and I work in the surf industry doing what I love, getting people in the water!</p>

        <div class="Hobbies">
            <h2>The Fun Stuff(Passions)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My passions for the ocean dive deep, pun intended. I love to surf, free-dive, fish, ect. If you name a sport in the ocean, I have done it and I loved it!</li>
                <li>Digging my teeth into a good book on a rainy day is always a must, especially if we are talking science fiction.</li>
                <li>I thirst for knowledge, no matter what it is. I currently am making a massive carrer jump from retail managing and buying to software engineering, I know, I'm crazy right! But coding has become a addiction that I can't get enough of and the knowledge I have learned in the past few months will push me to succeed in the field, I know it.</li>
