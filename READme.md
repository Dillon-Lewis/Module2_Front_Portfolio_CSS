# Mini Project: Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project

## Project Overview (Provided by Coding Temple)

Welcome to the Personal Portfolio Enhancement project, where you'll transform your basic portfolio into a visually stunning showcase of your skills. In this project, you'll harness CSS to breathe life into your portfolio, mastering typography, layout design, and advanced styling techniques. With CSS, you'll create visually appealing typography, manage spacing and sizing, and add interactivity using pseudoclasses like :hover, :active, and :focus.

You'll also learn advanced layout techniques such as CSS positioning, Flexbox, and Grid for responsive layouts. Master designing for different screen sizes with media queries, and elevate your design game with RGBA colors, gradients, shadows, transitions, and animations.

Gain experience in version control using Git and GitHub, and create clear project documentation, including an informative README file. Improve your project communication skills to explain technical concepts concisely.

Unleash your creativity and elevate your personal portfolio to the next level. By the end of this project, you'll have a polished showcase of your achievements and a solid foundation in CSS and web design principles. Let's dive in and make your portfolio shine! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

## Personal Portfolio Objectives

1. Simple and clean design
   * I personally have always found flashy designs unflattering so I decided for a more modern, minimalist approach. 
 * Blue is a calming color to read and attractive to the eye so I decided to use that color pallette for all of my project.By chance and unplanned, my clothing for my profile picture matched my color choices.

2. Attractive Homepage
   * I wanted to have my name the first thing you see. By increasing the font size drastically and adding a small 'text-shadow', your eyes are immediately drawn in that direction. 
   * I have a passion for creativity so I made my introduction message focus that energy.
   * A horizontal navigation bar that will be present in all the other pages and teleport you to the selected html. I added a simple :hover as well to each word so it will be noticed when trying to click it

3. About Me Page
   * I love to talk about my past because I am very greatful for all the opportunities I was given so I share a little bit of that information with the reader
   * A list of career goals that I hope to accomplish in the coming years, and the first step to that is learning the programs I am learning here!
   * A lost of some of my favorite hobbies that I try and do everyday.

4. Resume Page
    * A list of all the recent educational achivements I have had. 
    * I strong list of personal skills I have gained over the years of hard work.
    * My most recent work experience with dates and descriptions/acheivements while employed with the company
    * A list of all the certifications I have earned in my experiences. I am very new to coding and very proud and excited to show off my Backend Certification. I also do have it hyperlinked.
  
5. Portfolio
   * I decided to add 2 of my recent past projects from my time at coding temple. Each project also has a hyperlink connected to the image that will take you to the github repository of the project.
   * One of the main reasons I decided to get into coding weas because I wanted to take that knowledge to create my own programs and applications. I added a passion project I would like to do in the future

6. Blogs and Tesimonials Page
   * Create a blog that can be updated on my website at any time! I created a blog to talk about my class experiences
   * I added some of the positive feedback that I have received on past projects for Coding Temple as well! These would be replaced with reviews in a professional setting.
  
7. Connnections Page
   * Create a form that a user can fill out with there information so they can connect with yours truly. I utilized the 'textarea' function to add a larger text box for users to input any questions or concerns
  
## Technical Skills Done

* Developed a grid system that is uniform amoung all the htmls.
* Created Flexboxes inside grid sections to move images into the correct spots
* Created a fully functioning Vertical Navigation bar that also features a :hover effect.
* Added a functioning form that users have to fill out.

## Overall Experience

Since the start of my very short coding career, HTML has always been interesting to me. I have always considered myself to be very left-minded and creative person so this project really let me have some fun and not just look at code as numbers!
