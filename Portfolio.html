            <h3>Library Management system using SQL</h3>
            <p>In this project, we were tasked to integrate a MySQL database with Python to develop an advanced Library Management System. This command-line-based application is designed to streamline the management of books and resources within a library. Our goal was to create a robust system that allows users to browse, borrow, return, and explore a collection of books while demonstrating proficiency in database integration, SQL, and Python.</p>

            <h3>E-commerce API</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project was to build a user-friendly platform where customers can effortlessly browse products, add them to their shopping carts, and place orders. Simultaneously, administrators should have tools to manage product inventory, track orders, and ensure a seamless shopping experience. To tackle this challenge, I used the powers learned from Python, along with the new knowledge of Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, to accomplish this goal.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Action Sports Product Viewer:</strong> I am an avid surfer and have been for the past 20 years. Surfboards have such precise crafting and creation that makes every board perform in unique and different ways. I would like to create an application that a company can submit there products and I can create a 3D rendered image of the board. The boards would scale accordingly to the size dimensions provided by the company.<Br>
                The user can then access these images and be able to rotate the board in directions so that you can see things like the rocker, rail shape, and even down to the channels. It would be like being hands on without being hands on! </li>
